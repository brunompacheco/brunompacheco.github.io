    abstract = {State-of-the-art brain tumor segmentation is based on deep learning models applied to multi-modal MRIs. Currently, these models are trained on images after a preprocessing stage that involves registration, interpolation, brain extraction (BE, also known as skull-stripping) and manual correction by an expert. However, for clinical practice, this last step is tedious and time-consuming and, therefore, not always feasible, resulting in skull-stripping faults that can negatively impact the tumor segmentation quality. Still, the extent of this impact has never been measured for any of the many different BE methods available. In this work, we propose an automatic brain tumor segmentation pipeline and evaluate its performance with multiple BE methods. Our experiments show that the choice of a BE method can compromise up to 15.7% of the tumor segmentation performance. Moreover, we propose training and testing tumor segmentation models on non-skull-stripped images, effectively discarding the BE step from the pipeline. Our results show that this approach leads to a competitive performance at a fraction of the time. We conclude that, in contrast to the current paradigm, training tumor segmentation models on non-skull-stripped images can be the best option when high performance in clinical practice is desired.}

    abstract = {Applications that leverage the benefits of applying machine learning (ML) in production have been successfully realized. A fundamental hurdle to scale ML-based projects is the necessity of expertise from manufacturing and data science. One possible solution lies in automating the ML pipeline: integration, preparation, modeling and model deployment. This paper shows the possibilities and limits of applying AutoML in production, including a benchmarking of available systems. Furthermore, AutoML is compared to manual implementation in a predictive quality use case: AutoML still requires programming knowledge and is outperformed by manual implementation - but sufficient results are available in a shorter timespan.}
