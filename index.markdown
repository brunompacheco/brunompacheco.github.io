Hi!

I am a Systems and Automation Master's student at the [Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC)](https://en.ufsc.br/), supervised by professor [Eduardo Camponogara](https://eduardocamponogara.paginas.ufsc.br/).
My main research interest is on ways to enhance deep learning models by encoding information beyond features.
I am particularly interested in structured learning (learning on graphs) and regularization (physics-informed learning, Augmented Lagrangian), and machine learning applications in combinatorial optimization.
Currently, my research is focused on deep learning applications to mixed-integer linear programming and oil production optimization.
I have experience with deep learning for medical imaging, physics-informed learning, implicit models and HPO/AutoML.  <!-- TODO: add references for publications -->
