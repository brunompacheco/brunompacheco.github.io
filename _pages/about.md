My main research interest is on ways to enhance deep learning models by encoding information beyond features.
I am particularly interested in structured learning (learning on graphs) and regularization (physics-informed learning, Augmented Lagrangian), and machine learning applications in combinatorial optimization.
Currently, my research is focused on deep learning applications to mixed-integer linear programming and oil production optimization, under the supervision of professor [Eduardo Camponogara](https://eduardocamponogara.paginas.ufsc.br/).
Previously, I have worked with deep learning for medical imaging (under the supervisions of prof. [Danilo Silva](https://danilosilva.sites.ufsc.br/)), physics-informed learning and implicit models (B.Sc. thesis), and HPO/AutoML (during my internship at Fraunhofer IPT).  <!-- TODO: add references for publications -->
