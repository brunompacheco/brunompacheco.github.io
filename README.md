# Notes for future self

To run the site locally, first make sure that `bundle install`, then `bundle exec jekyll serve -w`. The option `-w/--watch` rebuilds the site upon changes. See (Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll)[https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll] for (a bit) more info.

I moved the sample posts to `_drafts/`, so that they will only show up when serving with `-D/--drafts` option.
